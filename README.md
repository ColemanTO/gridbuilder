#Responsive Grid Builder

The Responsive Grid Builder is a little web app that generates responsive CSS based on YUI Grids. 

##See it in action
Check out the app [here](http://yui.github.com/gridbuilder/). 

##A little tutorial and an example
The responsive CSS works by adding a single `yui3-g-responsive` class name, on top of the existing [YUI3 Grids syntax](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssgrids/). Check out the [documentation and a simple example](http://yui.github.com/gridbuilder/layout.html).
